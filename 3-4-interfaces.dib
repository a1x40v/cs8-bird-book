A new feature in C# 8.0 called default interface implementation allows you to include some implementation details in an interface definition.
If a class chooses to implement INamed, it will only be required to provide an implementation for this interfaceâ€™s Id property. It can also supply a Name property if it wants to, but this is not required. If the class does not define its own Name, the definition from the interface will be used instead.

#!csharp

public interface INamed
{
    int Id { get; }
    string Name => $"{this.GetType()}: {this.Id}";
}
